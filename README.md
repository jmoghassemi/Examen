# Examen
This repo investigates the setup and maintenance of lightweight Kubernetes (K8s) clusters that have monitoring and CI/CD pipelines capabilities. Alternatively, it is a limited survey of the K8s ecosystem, focusing on programs such as K3D (a lightweight K8s distributor), Grafana and Prometheus (for monitoring features), and Tekton (for CI/CD pipelines that are native to K8s).

Content:
Tekton-pipe-demo: Outlines how to install a simple pipeline in K8s clusters.
MongoDB-and-Express: Outlines how to deploy MongoDB to a cluster.
Grafana: Describes the setup of adding monitoring features through Helm charts.
